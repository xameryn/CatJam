# CatJam

A very scuffed bot made by some very scuffed men.

Run instructions:

- Install Node.js v16.10.0

- Open a terminal inside the root directory of the bot and enter 'npm install', this will install all the required node modules as specified in package.json

- Make sure Discord.js is using v12 and not v13 **(v13 breaks nearly every part of the bot)**!

- If updating from branch Version-1.0 run:

  - npm update
  - npm install

- Duplicate **(not rename or delete)** the file named 'CHECK_README.js' and name it 'keys.js'. Then enter tokens in 'keys.js'.

- Run CatJamsUtilities with either 'run.bat' or using 'npm start' in terminal.

# CatJam
A very scuffed bot made by a very scuffed man.

Run instructions:

- Install Node.js v16.10.0

- Open a terminal inside the root directory of the bot and enter 'npm install', this will install all the required node modules as specified in package.json

- Make sure Discord.js is using v12 and not v13 (v13 breaks nearly every part of the bot)!
